## Application Run Through

This application was created using Redux and ReactJS also will be hosted on GCloud. The purpose of this application was to learn the Redux and learn how to manipulate the data. 

## Application Design and Thought

Best practise was to design an expense application and learn to how to use Redux such as Store and Connect to manipulate the data. This would allow the users to add in the expenese and remove the expense while have the basic CRUD functionality.

## Installation on Client and Server

Need to install on client side and server side:

* `install-client` is to install the node packages for clients.
* `install-server` is to install the node packages for server.

## Running both Client and Server

Need to run the app for client side and server side:

* `dev` is to install the node packages for clients.
